 This program is based on my real life problem statement
 Date:-16-2-2025
 Day:-Tuesday
 Developer:-Aleena Parvez Shaikh
 Purpose:-I want through my   program any of the students will not waste their days due to their 
 mood swings.
Name Of The Project:Smart Study Planner Using Mood Analysis
 This will help each student to complete their work according to the theory and research based 
 program.
     Suggests subjects to focus on according to:
    * Positive mood → hardest or least interesting subjects
    * Negative mood → easiest subjects
    * Neutral mood → most interested or middle-interest subjects
- Supports dynamic handling of subjects depending on number entered.
